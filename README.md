# A PVP Multiplayer game

The design idea of the game was a player-vs-player ship game, where each player has a dock and can upgrade their ship near it. A lot of design decisions had to be changed when it came to upgrading the ship and the personal docks. The personally owned docks were bad as they only allowed the player to spawn at one place, which meant that spawn-killing became the most used tactic for winning games. The problem with the upgradable ship approach was that the game is fast-paced, and if there were no more personal docks in the game, adding a shop menu for some parts of the game seemed possible but the fast-paced nature made us choose other design decisions. The game assets were created by Kenney and were downloaded from [kenney](kenney.nl).

#### Heres a quick demo video of the finished result
